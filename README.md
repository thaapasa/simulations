# Simulations

This is a hobby project for running various simulations. Just for fun.

Currently I've implemented [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant),
but I have plans for adding at least [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
and [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
and [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) fractals.
